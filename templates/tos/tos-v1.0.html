                    <h3>Last updated January 13, 2013<strong> </strong></h3>
                    <p>This TD SERVICE Customer Agreement (this &ldquo;<strong>Agreement</strong>&ldquo;) contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Service Offerings (as defined below) and is an agreement between Amazon Web Services, Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>TD SERVICE</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>&rdquo;) and you or the entity you represent (&ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&ldquo;). This Agreement takes effect when you click an &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo; button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service Offerings (the &ldquo;<strong>Effective Date</strong>&ldquo;). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 14 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. Use of the Service Offerings.</h3>
                    <p><strong>1.1 Generally.</strong>&nbsp;You may access and use the Service Offerings in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements may apply to certain Service Offerings. You will adhere to all lTD Service, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Service Offerings, including the Service Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy and the other Policies as defined in Section 14.<br />
                      <strong>1.2 Your Account.</strong>&nbsp;To access the Services, you must create an TD SERVICE account associated with a valid e-mail address. Unless explicitly permitted by the Service Terms, you may only create one account per email address. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors or agents) and, except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account. You will contact us immediately if you believe an unauthorized third party may be using your account or if your account information is lost or stolen. You may terminate your account and this Agreement at any time in accordance with Section 7.<br />
                      <strong>1.3 Support to You.</strong>&nbsp;If you would like support for the Services other than the support we generally provide to other users of the Services without charge, you may enroll for customer support in accordance with the terms of the TD SERVICE Support Guidelines.<br />
                      <strong>1.4 Third Party Content.</strong>&nbsp;Third Party Content, such as software applications provided by third parties, may be made available directly to you by other companies or individuals under separate terms and conditions, including separate fees and charges. Because we may not have tested or screened the Third Party Content, your use of any Third Party Content is at your sole risk.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. Changes.</h3>
                    <p><strong>2.1 To the Service Offerings.</strong>&nbsp;We may change, discontinue, or deprecate any of the Service Offerings (including the Service Offerings as a whole) or change or remove features or functionality of the Service Offerings from time to time. We will notify you of any material change to or discontinuation of the Service Offerings.<br />
                      <strong>2.2 To the APIs.</strong>&nbsp;We may change, discontinue or deprecate any APIs for the Services from time to time but will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the previous version of any API changed, discontinued, or deprecated for 12 months after the change, discontinuation, or deprecation (except if doing so (a) would pose a security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) is needed to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities).<br />
                      <strong>2.3 To the Service Level Agreements.</strong>&nbsp;We may change, discontinue or add Service Level Agreements from time to time.</p>

                    <p><strong>3.1 TD SERVICE Security.</strong>&nbsp;Without limiting Section 10 or your obligations under Section 4.2, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.<br />
                      <strong>3.2 Data Privacy.</strong>&nbsp;We participate in the safe harbor programs described in the Privacy Policy. You may specify the TD SERVICE regions in which Your Content will be stored and accessible by End Users. We will not move Your Content from your selected TD SERVICE regions without notifying you, unless required to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities. You consent to our collection, use and disclosure of information associated with the Service Offerings in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and to the processing of Your Content in, and the transfer of Your Content into, the TD SERVICE regions you select.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><a name="4" id="4"></a>4. Your Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p><strong>4.1 Your Content.</strong>&nbsp;You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of Your Content. For example, you are solely responsible for:<br />
                      (a) the technical operation of Your Content, including ensuring that calls you make to any Service are compatible with then-current APIs for that Service;<br />
                      (b) compliance of Your Content with the Acceptable Use Policy, the other Policies, and the law;<br />
                      (c) any claims relating to Your Content; and<br />
                      (d) properly handling and processing notices sent to you (or any of your affiliates) by any person claiming that Your Content violate such person&rsquo;s rights, including notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.<br />
  <strong>4.2 Other Security and Backup.</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Service Offerings and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Your Content, which may include the use of encryption technology to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routine archiving Your Content. TD SERVICE log-in credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only and you may not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.<br />
  <strong>4.3 End User Violations.</strong>&nbsp;You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Service Offerings. You are responsible for End Users&rsquo; use of Your Content and the Service Offerings. You will ensure that all End Users comply with your obligations under this Agreement and that the terms of your agreement with each End User are consistent with this Agreement. If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement by an End User, you will immediately terminate such End User&rsquo;s access to Your Content and the Service Offerings.<br />
  <strong>4.4 End User Support.</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for providing customer service (if any) to End Users. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide support or services.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><a name="5" id="5"></a>5. Fees and Payment</h3>
                    <p><strong>5.1. Service Fees.</strong>&nbsp;We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as described on the TD SERVICE Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the TD SERVICE Site unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services by giving you at least 30 days&rsquo; advance notice. We may charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.<br />
                      <strong>5.2 Taxes.</strong>&nbsp;All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we reasonably request to determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you, including your VAT identification number. If you are legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring after the date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</p>
